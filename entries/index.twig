<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>
Phrozn is static web site generator written in PHP. 
</p>
<p>The idea is very simple:</p>
<p>
You write text files in your favorite format (Textile, Markdown, Twig etc), in your favorite environment (Vim, Vim, Vim
etc), spice them with styles (again, in your
favorite format - CSS, LESS, HASS), feed all this to Phrozn, and it will compile files into static HTML site ready to be published.
</p>

<h2 id="features">Features:</h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>Extensible:</b> Don't like <a href="/documentation/markup-processors/">supported markup processors</a>? Create
    your own, it is <a href="/documentation/articles/create-custom-markup-processor/">very easy</a>!
    <li><b>Easy to use:</b> If you are not afraid of command line - you'll be able to use Phrozn effeciently in no time.</li>
    <li><b>Complete:</b> Supports input files in Twig, Textile, Markdown, and LESS format</li>
    <li><b>Modern:</b> No love for pre PHP 5.3 hosts, Phrozn requires PHP 5.3+ and relies on it heavily</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h2>
<p>
Phrozn is not the only generator in the block, but definitely the best one written in PHP :) <br />
</p>
<p>
Seriously, Phrozn was created because I couldn't find any decent and well-written static site generator in PHP. There
are plenty of them written in Python and Ruby, and I definitely reviewed their source code when implementing Phrozn. 
</p>

<p>So, on the shoulders of giants we stand:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Jekyll</li>
    <li>Hyde</li>
</ul>
