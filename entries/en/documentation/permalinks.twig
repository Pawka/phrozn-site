<h1 id="main">Permalinks Strategies</h1>
<p>
Currently there's only one permalink strategy implemented.
</p>
<p>
However, Phrozn was designed in a way to allow any number of them - more info on this in successive releases.

Basically, you can specify explicitly where to output any given entry:
</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th width="35%">Permalink Setting</th>
        <th>Output File</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>/some/path/</code></td>
        <td>/some/path/index.html</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>/some/path</code></td>
        <td>/some/path.html</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>/some/path/:var/</code><br />provided that var is set to "value"</td>
        <td>/some/path/value/index.html</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>/some/path/:var</code><br />provided that var is set to "value"</td>
        <td>/some/path/value.html</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p>
So, in order to output a given entry into <code>/sub/folder/</code>, all you need to do is to include
<code>permalink: /sub/folder/</code> variable into entry's <a href="/en/documentation/front-matter/">YAML front-matter</a>:
</p>
<pre>
permalink: /sub/folder
---
&lt;p&gt;My first entry&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>
